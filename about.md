# Me

As a Senior Penetration Tester and Red Team Operator, My journey began with a foundational internship in cybersecurity, where I developed a keen understanding of network security principles.

Progressing to a role as a Penetration Tester and Red Team Operator, I deepened my skills in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities. This period was instrumental in refining my abilities in ethical hacking, network analysis, and security testing. My approach combined meticulous planning with a creative application of security tools and techniques.

In my current position as a Senior Penetration Tester and Red Team Operator, I have taken on a more strategic yet deep technical role. This involves leading complex penetration testing projects, developing innovative security solutions, and mentoring junior team members. My focus is on staying ahead of emerging threats and continuously enhancing our red teaming methodologies.

Additionally, as an Ambassador for Hack The Box, I contribute to the broader cybersecurity community, sharing knowledge and promoting best practices in ethical hacking.
