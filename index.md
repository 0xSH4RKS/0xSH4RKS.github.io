If you're here, you're probably interested in deep dives into tech, just as I am. This is where I document my explorations in red teaming, malware dev, training and everything in between.

Whether you're a seasoned tech enthusiast or just starting out, there's something here for everyone. Join me in this journey of discovery and problem-solving.

Stay curious,
